#  Potato Disease Classification using Deep Learning

This project applies a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using TensorFlow to classify potato leaf images into three categories: **Early Blight**, **Late Blight**, and **Healthy**. It aims to demonstrate the application of deep learning in plant disease detection using image data.

##  Project Highlights
- Built and trained a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Used the PlantVillage dataset with over 3,000 annotated images.
- Applied image preprocessing, data augmentation, and model tuning for improved performance.
- Achieved high classification accuracy and visualized predictions with sample outputs.

##  Dataset
Labeled dataset of potato leaves:
- Potato Early Blight  
- Potato Late Blight  
- Potato Healthy
